# cdr

Common Data Representation serialization and deserialization library written in pure Nim. 

This port based on the standalone typescript implemention at [foxglove/cdr](https://github.com/foxglove/cdr). 

Most all of the tests have been ported and work. However, please verify before using for anything critical.
